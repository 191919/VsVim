
F# 
 - Util classes should contain Create methods to create 
 - Revisit: Util classes should have Get for conversions 
 - Should be Of for collection conversions
 - Editor APIs 
     - APIs taking a count should return an option or explicitly guard against count being too large.  Users
       too often control this number
     - APIs taking a line number should consider returning an option.  Line numbers are less likely to be controlled
       by the user
 - Don't use ; for multi-line object initializers
 - A comma in an aurgment list / tuple should be followed by a space 
 - No space after ( or before )
 - To Deteremine:
    - Should functions returning an option be prefixed with Try? Example KeyNotationUtil 


C#
 - Member variables prefixed with _ 
 - Buffer creation methods should be Create.  Not CreateBuffer
