 - Util classes should contain Create methods to create 
 - Revisit: Util classes should have Get for conversions 
 - Should be Of for type conversions in util classes
    EditSnapshotSpan.OfSpan
    EditSnapshotSpan.OfBlock 
 - Editor APIs 
     - APIs taking a count should return an option or explicitly guard against count being too large.  Users
       too often control this number
     - APIs taking a line number should consider returning an option.  Line numbers are less likely to be controlled
       by the user
 - Don't use ; for multi-line object initializers
 - Add a space between ...
    - Values and arithmic operators and comparisions
    - Names and Values in record initializer expressions
    - Names and their types (foo : bar)
    - Keywords and open parens
        with get (
        if (
        elif (
    - {} the values in a record initializer 
 - Don't add a space between
    - Parens in everything but after keywords and discriminated union values
        x.Foo()
    - After the get in a mutable property defenition
        with get() = 
 - To Deteremine:
    - Should functions returning an option be prefixed with Try? Example KeyNotationUtil 

C#
 - Member variables prefixed with _ 
 - Buffer creation methods should be Create.  Not CreateBuffer

 Naming
 - Fields of specific types 
    - ITextView -> _textView
    - ITextBuffer -> _textBuffer
    - IVimBuffer -> _buffer
 - Unit Tests for handling a key combination
    - Handle_KeyCombo_
