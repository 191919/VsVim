 - Util classes should contain Create methods to create 
 - Revisit: Util classes should have Get for conversions 
 - Should be Of for collection conversions
 - Editor APIs 
     - APIs taking a count should return an option or explicitly guard against count being too large.  Users
       too often control this number
     - APIs taking a line number should consider returning an option.  Line numbers are less likely to be controlled
       by the user
