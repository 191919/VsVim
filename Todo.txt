Make sure that ; and , work as motions (repeat last char search)
Rename IMotionCapture -> IMotionBinder
Figure out the action when there is no matching command in normal mode for a key input (Beep, error message, etc ...)
Need to make sure key remapping in operators and such continues to work.  Data doesn't apepar to be leaving ICommandRunner::Run
	- Fixed it so the KeyRemapMode is used.  Still verify
Need to handle put + block registers
