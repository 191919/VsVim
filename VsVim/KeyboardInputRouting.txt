
This is intended to document the way in which keyboard input navigates throughout Visual 
Studio.  This process is complex due to in a large part it's history and attempts at 
ensuring backwards compatibility.  There are several layers from Win32 to WPF that all 
combine together to route input. 

This document is built purely from my experiences writing VsVim and debugging through many
user reported issues.  


Let’s start off with a high level view of the events and systems and the order in which they
fire
  1. PreTranslateMessage – Native windows messages.  May handle and swallow a message
  2. WPF and TextCompositionManager
     a. KeyDown
     b. TextInput
 
Now how the components in Visual Studio play together to route key input
 
  1. PreTranslateMessage – This is handled in msenv.  It has the first go and will attempt 
     to map keyboard input into a key boarding binding for a Visual Studio command.  It 
     will only attempt to map non-alphanumeric input or alphanumeric input which has a 
     modifier such as Shift, Control, Alt.  If it can find a match then it uses the key 
     stroke otherwise it gets passed on goes to #2
  2. WPF
    a. VisualElement raises the KeyDown.  KeyProcessor’s now come into play as they 
       indirectly subscribe to this event which they can interpret and handle. 
    b. TextCompositionManager receives the message and after much magic raises the 
       TextInput event on KeyProcessors. 
      i. Note: How the key is entered changes which field on TextComposition has the text.  
         For normal printable input the text will be on the Text property.  For items like 
         CTRL-M it will be on the ControlText property. 
      ii. One of the key processors is VsKeyProcessor which will turn every character in the 
        Text property of the argument into a TYPECHAR command.
